We’re again listening to events of “an imaginary world” that Taylor writes about. Many songs in this era were written with her boyfriend - Joe Alwyn. At this point they have been together for 5 years and writing some of the most beautiful songs in her discography. Example from this era: Champagne Problems.\",\n     ",
